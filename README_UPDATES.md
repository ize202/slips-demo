# ðŸš€ Slips Demo - Updated for Simplified Architecture

## What's New

The demo app has been updated to work with the **simplified database architecture** that uses automatic trustscore calculation via SQL triggers.

### Key Features:

1. **Database Status Dashboard**
   - Shows total products (205,782)
   - Products scored coverage percentage
   - Average score and distribution
   - Real-time stats from the core tables

2. **Dual Search Modes**
   - **Materialized View**: Ultra-fast search using `product_search` view (<50ms)
   - **Direct Query**: Fallback using joins on core tables (~100-200ms)
   - Toggle between modes to compare performance

3. **Stress Test Page** (`/stress-test`)
   - 10 comprehensive database tests
   - Tests trigger functionality
   - Concurrent query performance
   - Full-text search speed
   - Shows detailed timing for each test

### Database Architecture:

The app now queries the simplified 4-table structure:
- `labels` - Core product data
- `verification` - Boolean certifications
- `trustscores` - Auto-calculated scores
- `products` - Enhanced data

### How TrustScores Work:

1. Base score: 50 (FDA compliant)
2. Certifications add points (USP +10, NSF +10, etc.)
3. Issues deduct points (FDA flag -30)
4. **Automatic updates** when verification changes!

### To Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- http://localhost:3001 - Main search
- http://localhost:3001/stress-test - Performance testing

### Performance Targets:

- âœ… Search: <100ms (achieved with mat view)
- âœ… Score updates: Automatic via triggers
- âœ… 100% product coverage: All 205,782 products scored

### Testing the Triggers:

The stress test includes a "Trigger Test" that:
1. Updates a product's verification
2. Checks if trustscore updated automatically
3. Reverts the change

This proves the SQL triggers are working!
